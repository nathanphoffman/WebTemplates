		My name is Nathan Hoffman, I run a WordPress blog over at <a href="http://nathanphoffman.com">nathanphoffman.com</a> where I post on mainly astronomy and photography.  Recently I have been working on open source coding projects and really want to dive in-depth into the details of those projects.  This site serves that purpose.  
		<p>
		Webiota was created as my personal website for technical documentation, source code, and further in-depth analysis of coding.  I will introduce new projects over at my blog, with a simple explanation of their purpose, and document them further here.
		</p>

		On this page you will find the latest topic/addition to this website, below that you will find an overview of my active projects.

			<li class="links"><a href="#dataAnalysis">Talos Launcher (AutoIt & JS)</a><br/>This project uses AutoIt and Javascript to create a full-screen game launcher which is xbox-controller compatible.  It is an experiment of a web-browser embedded interface with access to the file system.</li>

		A while back we had a theoretical discussion at work on how one would go about grouping data together automatically.  My opinions on the matter differed from everyone else, and I wanted the opportunity to prove my methods would work.  Since I was not involved with the project, I figured I would pursue a version of my own which I developed on my own time.
